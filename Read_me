This code implements a non-inflationary blockchain with a transaction and mining system. 

In summary

Transaction Class:
Creates and manages transactions (transfer of value between wallets).
Transactions are signed with a private key and verified with the sender’s public key.

Block Class:
Each block contains a timestamp, transactions, and a hash of the previous block.
Performs proof-of-work to "mine" new blocks, solving a computational problem (finding hashes with a specific number of leading zeros).

Blockchain Class:
Manages a chain of blocks.
Allows adding transactions and "mining" blocks.
Implements a reward system for miners by adding a reward transaction to the block for the miner.
Verifies the integrity of the blockchain, ensuring all transactions are valid.

Functionality:
Transaction creation and signing: Users (defined by public and private keys) can make transactions between each other.
Mining: For each block, miners are rewarded (in this case, 10 units) for processing the block.
Balance checking: For each wallet (public key), the current balance can be checked.

In practice, it’s a blockchain model similar to Bitcoin, with the ability to add transactions, mine new blocks, and verify the chain’s integrity.
